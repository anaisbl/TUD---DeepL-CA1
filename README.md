# Deep Learning - Continuous Assessment

## Project Overview
This project is the final Continuous Assessment for the course "Deep Learning (SPEC9993)" as part of the Data Science program (TU059) at TU Dublin. It was divided into two parts: **Song Genre Prediction** and **Image Processing & Transfer Learning**.

### Task Description
- **Part 1: Song Genre Prediction**
  - Developed a deep neural network to predict the genre of a song.
  - Utilized a dataset from **Kaggle** for training and evaluation.
  - Implemented various **deep learning techniques** to enhance model accuracy.

- **Part 2: Image Processing & Transfer Learning**
  - Used the **CIFAR-100 dataset** to perform image classification tasks.
  - Applied **image processing techniques** for data augmentation and feature extraction.
  - Leveraged **transfer learning** with pre-trained models to improve classification performance.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for deep learning experiments.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Implementing and training neural networks.
- **Scikit-learn**: Additional machine learning utilities.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
