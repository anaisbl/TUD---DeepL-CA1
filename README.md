<h1>Deep Learning - Continuous Assessment 1</h1>
<h4>Continuous Assessment part of the requirements of the Deep Learning course (SPEC9993) in the TU059 program at TU Dublin.</h4>
The CA is separated into 2 parts: Song genre prediction and Image processing & transfer learning.<br><br>
<h5>Part 1</h5>
The task at hand is to predict the genre of a song using one input feature, and then two through deep neural network models and methods. The dataset is the multilingual lyrics one from Kaggle comprising of two files: train and test. The train dataset will be used for training, validating and initial testing, and the test dataset for final testing.
<h5>Part 2</h5>
Using the CIFAR-100 dataset, we are tasked to randomly split the dataset into 2 subsets of 50 classes each and performa range of image processing and transfer learning operations.
